__Simone:__ Created a game using Javascript based off the electronic game Simon.

__Goal:__ I created this to practice my vanilla Javascript skills post bootcamp. 
It provided some good testing & problem solving practice to get the game mechanics just right.

__Instructions:__

1) Press A to start a new game... or don't, and see where that gets you.

2) Observe Simone's pattern & repeat it to advance to the next level.

__How good is *YOUR* memory?__
